# This-is-it-
2D animation Clip using Blender

  It is short animation created using grease pencil feature of Blender of about 800 frames with audio.
  
  It’s a small animation of different stages of a person’s life.
A kid happy to play and grow up to be a boy ambitions and a stage where maturity comes up living the suddenly time flies and his shoulders are big enough to take responsibilities and work, working for family and to be successful he forgets to enjoy life, sit around and give a thought to day and one day his shoulders droop and he close enough only to the ground and the almighty takes him for another birth. 
Life is not just about being a kid, being ambitions, taking responsibilities and then leaving the world. We are here to serve others life and to better up our experience with the ages we leave, set an example for someone losing hope to survive a day.
